## The motivation for quantum field theory

As far as we know, all matter in the universe is quantum in nature. Quantum mechanics governs the behavior of all matter, and at an introductory and intermediate level, the dynamics of quantum systems is typically solved with the Schrödinger equation:

{% math() %}
i\hbar \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \left(-\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\right) \Psi(x, t)
{% end %}

However, relativistic quantum field theory is a far more accurate theory of quantum mechanics than the Schrödinger equation. In fact, while we may use approximations like (semi-)classical theory and nonrelativistic or single-particle quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and specifically the Standard Model, offers the best and most accurate results. 

That is to say, any quantum system may be solved for by the Schrödinger equation, but doing the same calculations with quantum field theory offers results with unparalleled precision. Predictions of the [magnetic moment of electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment), [energy levels of the hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift), a variety of [previously-unknown elementary particles](https://physics.info/standard/), and the [Rydberg constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_constant) made through quantum field theory have been experimentally tested and confirmed very well.

These are not meaningless predictions either; our understanding of the emission and absorption of light, of the subatomic origins of magnetism, and even our standard of time in the [definition of a second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second) are based on these predictions. In turn, numerous scientific experiments, material science, laser technology, and electronics depend on applying these predictions, without which they would likely not progress to how they are today.
