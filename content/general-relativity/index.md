## Introduction

General Relativity is doubtlessly one of the most beautiful theories of physics ever devised. It is, sadly, also quite complicated. We hope this attempt to explain it, going step-by-step through all the little details, will hopefully clear up some of the confusion for first-time learners, while still doing the subject justice.
