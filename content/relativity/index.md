## Introduction

The two theories of relativity - Special Relativity and General Relativity - are doubtlessly some of the most beautiful theories of physics ever devised. They are, sadly, also quite complicated. We hope this attempt to explain them, going step-by-step through all the little details, will hopefully clear up some of the confusion for first-time learners, while still doing the subject justice.
