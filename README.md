# A Learner’s Guide to Advanced Theoretical Physics

This is a free, open-source online book series dedicated to explaining theoretical physics in a more accessible way. The ultimate goal is that anyone with a high-school education (and sufficient diligence) should be able to work their way to understanding modern theoretical physics. It is very work-in-progress at the moment, but with time, it can hopefully grow to become a useful learning resource. 

> _"You ask me if an ordinary person—by studying hard—would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course. I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing, and they learned all this stuff. They're just people.

> There's no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics, then \[they've\] become a scientist."_ **Richard Feynman**
